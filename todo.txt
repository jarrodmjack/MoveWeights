Add workout templates feature:
Continue working on the /create frontend route. Left off getting the musclegroup/exercise name selects working. Need to add a handler to add an object to the template exercises array.

See if I can add the .lean method on any of my get queries to mongo (optimization)

Update node to 18 on machine and docker files

Make app look good on desktop
