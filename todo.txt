Add workout templates feature:
Set up backend controller for creating a template. I updated the template model to have exercises: [{exerciseName: String, muscleGroup: String}] so that should be okay for types.

Plan for templates is -> User can apply a template to the current workout (Just does an insertMany on Exercise Model and creates a workout if no workoutId is present)

See if I can add the .lean method on any of my get queries to mongo (optimization)

Update node to 18 on machine and docker files

Make app look good on desktop
