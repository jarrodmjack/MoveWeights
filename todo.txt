Add workout templates feature:
Create controller/routes

    For creation:
    On the frontend, can get an array of objects (modeled after Exercise Object) pass back to controller.
    Use insertMany to insert array of objects

    For deletion:
    Onclick event, sends a template id to the backend. Go in an delete many (array of ids?)

See if I can add the .lean method on any of my get queries to mongo (optimization)

Update node to 18 on machine and docker files
