Work on the createWorkout function in workout/create route. I have the data coming in from the form, just need to send data to the controller and perform logic on the backend.

The logic will be:

find workout by todays date.
If no workout createdAt date that matches todays date, create a new workout and return
else return workout

On the front end, I will need to set this workout in context somehow
