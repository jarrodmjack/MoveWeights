improve render times by moving state manipulation in front of requests (eg, adding exercise, etc so it looks instant)

Add exercise deletion functionality (WIP)

Re-do loading state on exercise addition (maybe remove button after add)
Test all loading states on prod - look for any weird ones.

Make app look good on desktop
