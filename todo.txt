I need to find a way to save the unsplash image urls per country and then I can have access to them on initial page load. I want the images to be displayed right in a flex/grid type layout right under the advisory.

On initial load of a country in the AI route, I should check if the country exists, if not create it. I would then have to modify the logic inside of the sendPrompt function when checking if country exists and instead check if the AI data exists (checking if one of the arrays is populated)
