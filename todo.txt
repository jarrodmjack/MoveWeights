continue working on analytics. Data is coming in from the backend for getting the set count, but I want to map the counts to an object with the muscle group names so I can create the table -> e.g. [{musclegroup: "back", setCount: 8}]


Update node to 18 on machine and docker files

improve render times by moving state manipulation in front of requests (eg, adding exercise, etc so it looks instant)

Re-do loading state on exercise addition (maybe remove button after add)
Test all loading states on prod - look for any weird ones.

Make app look good on desktop
